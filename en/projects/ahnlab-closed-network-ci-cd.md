# 🔹 Closed-Network Integrated CI/CD System

## 📌 Project Overview
Designed and built an integrated CI/CD pipeline to ensure high release quality in an isolated (closed-network) environment. Developed a system that automatically delivers distributed build results from the R&D network to the test network, and links QA automation for full verification coverage.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Automated release schedule crawler and pre-release task execution
- Designed and managed Jenkins-based pipelines
- Synchronized build output delivery across isolated R&D → test network
- Integrated QA test cases for automated validation

## 🌟 Achievements
- Established fully automated build and test pipeline
- Improved consistency and reliability of release quality
- Boosted QA team efficiency via cross-network test automation

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Jenkins, Ansible, Python, Bash
- Git, Internal Build Infrastructure

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Practical experience designing CI/CD pipelines in air-gapped environments
- Strengthened automation design thinking with a cross-functional workflow perspective
