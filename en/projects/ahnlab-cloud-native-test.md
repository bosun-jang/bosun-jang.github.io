# 🔹 Cloud-Native Automated Test System

## 📌 Project Overview
Built a cloud-native testing pipeline using Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure automation. Jenkins orchestrates the full flow from environment provisioning to test execution and result collection.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Modularized infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible
- Designed full CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins
- Automated environment provisioning and test flow
- Collected logs and test reports for analysis

## 🌟 Achievements
- Reduced environment setup time by over 50x
- Enhanced maintainability with infrastructure-as-code
- Improved reliability in complex test environments

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Bash, Python
- AWS (or private cloud)

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- End-to-end automation in cloud environments
- Effective integration of IaC and CI/CD principles
