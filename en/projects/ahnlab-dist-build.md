# 🔹 Distributed Build System

## 📌 Project Overview
Designed and built a distributed build system for compiling thousands of kernel modules efficiently. Used Docker and Jenkins to parallelize builds across 20+ VMs.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Provisioned VM build environments using Ansible
- Designed Docker-based parallel build system
- Integrated Jenkins pipeline for scalable build automation

## 🌟 Achievements
- Achieved 5x faster build performance
- Unified build environment for consistency and reproducibility
- Improved fault tolerance and debugging across build jobs

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Shell Script
- Git, Linux Kernel Toolchains

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Benefits of container-based parallel build environments
- Optimizing CI pipelines for large-scale codebases
