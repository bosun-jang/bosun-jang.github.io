# 🔹 On-Premise Kernel Test Automation

## 📌 Project Overview
Automated kernel module testing in on-premise environments by integrating a kernel environment collector with a test execution pipeline using Jenkins and scripting.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Built test environments based on kernel version and distro
- Integrated with a kernel collector for real-time test configuration
- Designed Jenkins pipeline and shell scripts for automation

## 🌟 Achievements
- Reduced setup time and improved productivity
- Automatically validated newly collected kernel environments
- Achieved consistent, cost-effective test automation

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Jenkins, Bash, Python, Shell Script
- Linux (multiple distros), internal kernel collectors

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Orchestrating dynamic test flows based on real-time data
- Designing test infrastructure for legacy and modern kernel variants
