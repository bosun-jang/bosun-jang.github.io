# 🔹 TLS Traffic Inspection Development

## 📌 Project Overview
Designed and developed functionality to monitor and decrypt SSL/TLS encrypted traffic in real time and detect threats. Built a scalable system that adapts to multiple encryption algorithms (PFS, DH, etc.).

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Analyzed TLS packet structure and encryption algorithm behaviors
- Developed a kernel-level network monitoring module
- Implemented threat detection on decrypted traffic
- Automated configuration setup for different enterprise environments

## 🌟 Achievements
- Improved traffic handling from 5 to over 1000 sessions
- Delivered client-specific TLS inspection features
- Boosted threat detection efficiency and trustworthiness

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- C, Linux Kernel Module, TLS/SSL Protocol
- OpenSSL, Wireshark, Bash

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Practical experience with encryption algorithms and network security
- Designed high-performance monitoring systems with resource optimization
