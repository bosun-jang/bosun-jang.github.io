# 🔹 Optional Keyboard Firmware Development

## 📌 Project Overview
Developed STM32-based firmware for optional front-facing keyboards used in MFPs, enabling input processing and peripheral expansion.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Implemented key input handling using STM32 HAL
- Designed interrupt logic for detecting peripheral connections
- Established communication protocol with printer core
- Added keyboard boot/init authentication routine

## 🌟 Achievements
- Stabilized device control via external keyboard
- Enabled support for extended peripheral configurations
- Improved field maintenance and customer satisfaction

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- STM32 HAL, C, UART, GPIO, FreeRTOS (partial)
- Logic Analyzer, Oscilloscope

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Real-time firmware development with microcontrollers
- Interface design for optional embedded peripherals
