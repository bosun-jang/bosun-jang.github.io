# 🔹 Log and Debugging System Enhancements

## 📌 Project Overview
Improved failure response and disk management by enhancing log collection and compression systems for MFPs. Implemented real-time collection for print/scan/fax logs and automated disk space handling.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Implemented RPC-based log collection for core modules
- Integrated systemd-journald to gather journal logs
- Developed compression logic triggered by disk usage
- Standardized timestamps for consistent log correlation

## 🌟 Achievements
- Improved debugging capabilities in production environments
- Reduced disk usage through efficient log rotation
- Streamlined field maintenance with consistent log data

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- C, RPC, systemd-journald, pstore
- Shell Script, gzip/bzip2

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Designed real-time logging flows for embedded systems
- Balanced performance and log traceability in production
