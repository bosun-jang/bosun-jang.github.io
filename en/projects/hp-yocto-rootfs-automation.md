# 🔹 Yocto-Based RootFS Automated Build

## 📌 Project Overview
Transitioned from a legacy build process to a Yocto-based RootFS system to enable modular builds and automated SDK generation for embedded firmware.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Defined Yocto recipes for kernel, rootfs, and boot configs
- Created SDK packaging and deployment scripts
- Managed toolchain compatibility across builds
- Documented shared workflows for internal engineering teams

## 🌟 Achievements
- Improved maintainability of RootFS image builds
- Enabled flexible cross-compilation toolchain changes
- Facilitated reuse of SDKs across different projects

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Yocto, BitBake, Shell Script
- Embedded Linux, SDK distribution

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Mastered modular build systems using Yocto
- Strengthened cross-project maintainability through automation
