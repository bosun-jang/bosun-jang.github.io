# 🔹 Device Monitoring Feature Development

## 📌 Project Overview
Designed a lightweight monitoring system for CPU temperature, USB connection status, and other runtime device states in embedded MFP systems.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Gathered hardware metrics from /proc and sysfs
- Built real-time logging for temperature and power events
- Integrated warning thresholds and alert mechanisms
- Provided debug interfaces for internal QA teams

## 🌟 Achievements
- Enabled proactive device maintenance and diagnostics
- Improved reliability and serviceability in the field
- Reduced support request resolution time

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Embedded C, sysfs, ioctl, Linux kernel interfaces
- Shell Script, log buffer tools

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Practical experience with low-level hardware telemetry
- Building resilient monitoring tools under resource constraints
